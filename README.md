## Problem Statement
SpaceX has revolutionized the space launch industry with its reusable Falcon 9 rocket, significantly reducing the cost of launches to approximately 62 million dollars compared to the 165 million dollars or more charged by other providers. The key factor in achieving these savings is the successful landing and reuse of the rocket's first stage. Predicting the landing outcome of the Falcon 9 first stage is crucial for determining the cost of a launch.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a machine learning pipeline that can predict the landing outcome of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage. This prediction aims to enhance the decision-making process for cost estimation of rocket launches. By accurately predicting whether the first stage will land successfully, the model can provide valuable insights for alternative space launch providers to bid competitively against SpaceX. This, in turn, can lead to significant cost savings and better resource allocation in the space industry.

The problem we aim to solve in this project is:
"Can we accurately predict whether the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully based on historical launch data?"
