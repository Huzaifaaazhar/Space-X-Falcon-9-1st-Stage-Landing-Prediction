The function should handle any potential errors that occur during the calculation. To do this, you can use a try-except block. If any exception arises during the calculation, it should catch the error using the generic exception class `\"Exception\" as \"e\"`. When an exception occurs, the function should display `\"An error occurred during calculation.`\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"69ec97bd-6d7d-4393-b95a-db4656a8806f","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Type your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3f032cd4-aff5-40a8-b8bf-e29899a54a6e","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["**Note:- Practice handling exceptions by trying different input types like using integers, strings, zero, negative values, or other data types.**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"972ea511-186a-4662-af24-fb8f28a88f23","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick here for the hints\u003c/summary\u003e\n","\n","```python\n","Follow these:-\n","* Define a function for the complex calculation and pass any argument.\n","* Use a try-except block for error handling.\n","* Perform the calculation and store the result in \"result.\"\n","* Catch any exceptions using Exception as e.\n","* Display \"An error occurred during calculation.\" when an exception is caught.\n","* take user input\n","* Call the defined function with the user input\n","**Note:- Test with different inputs to validate error handling.**\n","```\n","\n","\u003c/details\u003e\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6c53f69a-9774-4ecf-8dd8-7abd8f8eb835","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick here for the solution\u003c/summary\u003e\n","\n","```python\n","def complex_calculation(num):\n","    try:\n","        result = num / (num - 5)\n","        print (f\"Result: {result}\")\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(\"An error occurred during calculation.\")\n","# Test case\n","user_input = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n","complex_calculation(user_input)\n","```\n","\n","\u003c/details\u003e\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5c578c9e-edeb-4faf-b632-de07c1691ff3","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Authors\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"428e5c61-9f3b-4352-a4b0-42b08e558f5e","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-s-50398b136/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJoseph Santarcangelo\u003c/a\u003e\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0b840493-724a-4b63-bd30-9319a4c628c5","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Change Log\n","\n","|  Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |  Version | Changed By  |  Change Description |\n","|---|---|---|---|\n","| 2023-08-0 | 2.1   | Akansha Yadav | Added optional practice section |\n","| 2020-09-02  | 2.0  | Simran | Template updates to the file|\n","|   |   |   |   |\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","## \u003ch3 align=\"center\"\u003e © IBM Corporation 2020.
